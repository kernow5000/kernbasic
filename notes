Some basic rules:

line numbers can't be more than 256 chars long
line numbers must be in order
// not yet - input file must have a .bas extension (check for this on open)




Open a file and parse it first I guess. 

The main thing to do first is parse and run a 'hello world' basic
program. Then we can move onto the code below from a wikipedia example
of a simple basic program. 



code:
10 INPUT "What is your name: ", U$
20 PRINT "Hello "; U$
30 INPUT "How many stars do you want: ", N
40 S$ = ""
50 FOR I = 1 TO N
60 S$ = S$ + "*"
70 NEXT I
80 PRINT S$
90 INPUT "Do you want more stars? ", A$
100 IF LEN(A$) = 0 THEN GOTO 90
110 A$ = LEFT$(A$, 1)
120 IF A$ = "Y" OR A$ = "y" THEN GOTO 30
130 PRINT "Goodbye "; U$
140 END


result when run:

What is your name: Mike
Hello Mike
How many stars do you want: 7
*******
Do you want more stars? yes
How many stars do you want: 3
***
Do you want more stars? no
Goodbye Mike
